Neatline Features offers the ability to encode and edit geospatial shape
information for Omeka items using a pleasant graphical interface.

## Installation

Installing this plugin is as easy as 1, 2, 3. Here's how:

1.  [Download](https://github.com/scholarslab/NeatlineFeatures/downloads) the
    latest version of this code and drop it into `omeka/plugins`.
2.  Once the `NeatlineFeatures` directory is in place, you'll need to log into
    the Omeka admin console and install it on the plugins page.
3.  Umm. That's it. Look at the *Coverage* field of any item, and you can start
    adding spatial annotations.
