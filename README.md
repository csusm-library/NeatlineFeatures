NeatlineFeatures was created by the [Scholars' Lab][1] and allows Omeka users to visually manipulate geographic features with simple editors and combine features with material from [NeatlineMaps][2] to create even more powerful interactive maps.

The NeatlineFeatuers plugin is currently under development by the [Scholars' Lab][3] and may be accessed through the  [plugin subversion repository][4]. If you are interested in helping out, or have questions regarding the plugin, please let us know by posting a note on the [Omeka Developer's List][5].
